# Compliance Strategy

## Overview

ARIA is designed for institutional adoption with built-in regulatory compliance.

## KYC/AML Implementation

### Current (Hackathon Demo)

- Self-attested KYC (honor system)
- On-chain attestation via `kycStatus` mapping
- Tiered access: None → Basic → Verified → Accredited

### Production Roadmap

- Fractal ID integration (ZK-KYC)
- Civic Pass for sybil resistance
- Chainlink Proof of Reserve for backing verification

## Regional Restrictions

- OFAC sanctions list checked (North Korea, Iran, Syria, etc.)
- EU GDPR compliant (right to erasure via IPFS unpinning)
- US securities law aware (Reg D/S exemptions for accredited investors)

## Data Privacy

- Document metadata encrypted before IPFS upload
- Only hash stored on-chain
- User controls access via NFT ownership

## Audit Trail

- Every transaction logged on Mantle blockchain
- Immutable verification records
- Real-time monitoring via Compliance Dashboard

## Risk Mitigation

- AI fraud detection (future dates, anomalies)
- Community governance (flagging system)
- Multi-sig custody for high-value assets ($100K+)

## Regulatory Readiness
